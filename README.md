# Pager ðŸ“–

Created by [Emily Villett](https://github.com/MeowPup) and [Curtis Wilson](https://github.com/curtis-wils0n) for Lighthouse Labs' full-time web development bootcamp final project.

> This project is intended as a proof of concept, and should not be hosted or used as a secure, stand-alone site.

## Summary

Pager is a simple, user-driven social media platform designed for readers to collect, review, and curate lists of their favourite books.

By paring down the plethora of features offered by current book-review platforms, Pager offers a cleaner, more approachable solution that focuses on expanding your collections.

## Tech Stack

Pager utilizes React, Material UI, and Express to interact with its PostgreSQL database, hosted [here](https://github.com/curtis-wils0n/pager-api).
